# smartfeed
Smartfeed Extension for phpBB 3.1 and 3.2
Please note that when deployed the extension will go under ext/phpbbservices/smartfeed. Only the Smartfeed tree is shown here.
If there is no vendor folder in the archive, then you will need to run composer.phar with the install option which will 
retrieve the SimplePie library, which will be placed in /vendor/simplepie/simplepie.
